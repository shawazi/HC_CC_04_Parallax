Still very different from target: https://mark-mad.github.io/parallax-website/

top and bottom purple boxes are smaller than they should be, and the font is different, although i tried to copy the same font (using font-weight: 400 didn't fix it either, but i didn't import any special 400 weight 'Lato' font variant).
